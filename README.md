## Hi I'm Sean ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-time software developer currently based in Raleigh North Carolina. 

I am a UNC Charlotte computer science alumni and a programming hobbyist. Here you can find all of the stuff I do for fun outside of work such as personal projects, self-teaching new concepts, and 3D printing.
